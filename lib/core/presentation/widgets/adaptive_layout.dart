/// An [AdaptiveLayout] widget provides a way to create responsive layouts
/// in Flutter applications.
/// It adapts the UI based on the screen size, allowing
/// for a tailored user experience across
/// different devices such as mobile, tablet, and web platforms.
///
/// This widget uses a [LayoutBuilder] to determine the available
/// width and switches between
/// different layouts accordingly. It is designed to simplify the creation
/// of responsive UIs
/// by encapsulating the layout decision logic.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [mobileLayout]: A [WidgetBuilder] function that returns the layout
///   for mobile devices.
///   This layout is used when the screen width is less than 600 pixels.
///
/// - [tabletLayout]: A [WidgetBuilder] function that returns the layout
///   for tablet devices.
///   This layout is used when the screen width is between 600 and 1200 pixels.
///
/// - [webLayout]: A [WidgetBuilder] function that returns the layout
///   for web and larger screens.
///   This layout is used when the screen width is greater than 1200 pixels.
///
/// Usage:
/// dart```
/// AdaptiveLayout(
///   mobileLayout: (context) => MobileLayout(),
///   tabletLayout: (context) => TabletLayout(),
///   webLayout: (context) => WebLayout(),
/// )
///  ```dart
///
/// This approach ensures that the correct layout is
/// used for the device's screen size, and it
/// defers the creation of the widget until it is actually needed,
///  based on the platform's screen size.
